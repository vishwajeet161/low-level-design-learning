## Overview

Low-Level Design involves designing individual components and their interactions within a system. This repo serves as a practice ground for implementing various design patterns, data structures, and algorithms that form the building blocks of robust software systems.

## Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
├── problems/          # Individual problem solutions
│   ├── design-patterns/
│   ├── data-structures/
│   ├── system-design/
│   └── algorithms/
├── utils/             # Common utilities and helpers
├── tests/             # Unit tests for the solutions
└── docs/              # Additional documentation
```
